M2 internship of Emile Dosso under the supervision of Mr. Reza Ansari at the CEA/DRF/IRFU/LCEG.

Galaxy clusters, the most massive cosmic structures, group together up to a few hundred galaxies. They have a total mass of between 10^13 and 10^15 solar masses, dominated by dark matter, which accounts for around 85% of the total mass. Hot intracluster gas, at temperatures of a few 10^6 K, is the second most massive component, accounting for 10% of the total mass, with galaxies making up only 5%.

Galaxy clusters can be identified in optical surveys as an overdensity of galaxies, and in X-ray observations as an extended source, through the emission of hot gas. They can also be identified by the SZ (Sunyaev-Zeldovich) effect in maps of the cosmic microwave background.

Cluster counting, number density as a function of mass and redshift (dN/dM dz) is a cosmological probe, sensitive in particular to matter density and the amplitude of density fluctuations (sigma8). However, the total mass of clusters is often not a directly accessible quantity, so we have to rely on observables such as the temperature of the gas, measurable in X, or the number of galaxies in the cluster, called the optical richness, linked to mass by scaling relations.

Increasingly complete catalogs of galaxy clusters, covering a large fraction of the sky, are becoming available, thanks to data from optical and X-ray surveys, including SZ. However, the number of clusters detected in optical surveys is significantly higher than those detected in X-ray surveys. Of course, selection biases, survey specificities and associated detection methods have to be taken into account.
The proposed internship involves a cross-analysis of optically detected galaxy clusters from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and X-ray detected clusters from the ROSAT satellite and the recently published X-ray catalog from eRosita observations (eRASS1). The aim is to obtain a simplified estimate of the selection functions, and to compare optical and X-ray count rates.
